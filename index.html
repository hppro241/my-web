    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Big Bang Theory</h2>
      <p>The Big Bang is the leading explanation for the origin of the universe. It suggests that the universe began as an extremely hot and dense point, and has been expanding ever since.</p>
      <p>About 13.8 billion years ago, this point exploded in a massive event, which continues to shape the universe's evolution to this day. As the universe expanded, it cooled, allowing matter to form into stars, planets, and galaxies.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="stars" class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Stars and Their Formation</h2>
      <p>Stars are the building blocks of galaxies. They are born from clouds of gas and dust, known as nebulae. Through the process of nuclear fusion, a star is formed when hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing enormous amounts of energy.</p>
      <p>Stars vary in size and temperature, and they eventually go through different phases: from main-sequence stars to red giants or supergiants, and ultimately ending in supernovae or black holes.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="galaxies" class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Galaxies: The Building Blocks of the Universe</h2>
      <p>Galaxies are vast collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter. Our home, the Milky Way, is just one of billions of galaxies in the universe. Some galaxies are spiral-shaped, like the Milky Way, while others are elliptical or irregular.</p>
      <p>Galaxies interact and collide, leading to the formation of new stars and sometimes merging into larger galaxies. The study of galaxies helps astronomers understand the scale and structure of the universe.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="solar-system" class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Our Solar System</h2>
      <p>Our solar system consists of the Sun, eight planets, and numerous moons, asteroids, and comets. The Sun is a medium-sized star that provides the energy needed for life on Earth.</p>
      <p>The planets in our solar system include Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each planet has its own unique characteristics, such as atmospheres, rings, and moons.</p>
      <p>Earth, our home planet, is the only known place in the universe that supports life, thanks to its distance from the Sun and the presence of liquid water.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="future" class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Future of the Universe</h2>
      <p>The future of the universe is still a mystery. The universe is expanding, and scientists predict that it will continue to do so for billions of years. This expansion could eventually lead to the "Big Freeze," where stars burn out, and galaxies drift apart, leaving behind a cold and dark universe.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, some theories suggest the universe may eventually collapse back in on itself in a "Big Crunch," or even expand indefinitely in a "Big Rip." These possibilities depend on factors like dark energy and the rate of expansion of the universe.</p>

      <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. It involves the creation of algorithms and models that allow machines to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence.</p>
      <p>These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI systems can be as simple as a chatbot or as advanced as self-driving cars.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="types" class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Types of AI</h2>
      <p>AI can be categorized into three main types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI):</strong> This is the most common form of AI and refers to systems that are designed to perform a specific task, such as facial recognition or language translation.</li>
        <li><strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):</strong> AGI refers to machines that can perform any cognitive task that a human can do, with the ability to reason, plan, and solve problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):</strong> This is the hypothetical future AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects, potentially leading to machines that can improve themselves autonomously.</li>
